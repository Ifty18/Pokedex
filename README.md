# Pokédex

<a href="https://ifty-s-pokedex.netlify.app/pokemon/6">Pokédex</a> is a web platform which keeps the record of all pokemons.
This project was done over the course of 5 weeks during my participation to <a href="https://fiipractic.asii.ro">FiiPractic</a>'s React course. There I got to learn the basics about this library by creating a web application from scratch.

### Application overview

The main page displays the list of pokemons:

The data is retrieved using API calls made to <a href="https://pokeapi.co">Pokeapi</a>. The idea of the project was to create only the frontent and make use of existing APIs in order to obtain data.

Each card can be clicked in order to view more details about the selected pokemon. Stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, etc. and also the pokemon's evolutions can be seen:

### Deployment

The application was deployed using <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> since it was an easy and free option.
